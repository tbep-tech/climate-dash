Precipitation data is sourced from [PRISM](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/), providing:

- Daily precipitation totals (rain and snow)
- Coverage: Conterminous US from 1981 to present
- Resolution: 4km grid cells
- Values in millimeters (mm)
- 30-year normals (1981-2010) used for analysis since 2004
- Prior to 2004, 30-year normals from 1961-1990 were used

Data is processed through a combined dataset of ground gauge station and RADAR products. Updates follow the same schedule as temperature data, see the [PRISM update schedule](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/calendar/list.php) for details.
