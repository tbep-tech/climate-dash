Sea level data comes from [NOAA Tides & Currents](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/) stations, providing:

- Monthly mean sea level measurements
- Long-term sea level trends
- Relative sea level changes that reflect both:
  - Changes in local sea level over time
  - Vertical land motion
- Critical for coastal applications including:
  - Coastal mapping
  - Marine boundary delineation
  - Coastal zone management
  - Sustainable habitat restoration design

Data is collected through the [National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON)](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/nwlon.html) and processed according to [NOAA's quality control standards](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/faq.html).
