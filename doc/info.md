# Air Temperature

Air temperature data is sourced from PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) climate data. PRISM provides high-quality spatial climate data sets developed by Oregon State University. The data includes:

- Daily minimum and maximum temperatures
- Coverage: Conterminous US from 1981 to present
- Resolution: 4km grid cells
- Data is typically updated within 24 hours

# Rainfall

Precipitation data is also sourced from PRISM, providing:

- Daily precipitation totals
- Coverage: Conterminous US from 1981 to present
- Resolution: 4km grid cells
- Values in millimeters (mm)
- 30-year normals (1981-2010) used for analysis since 2004
- Prior to 2004, 30-year normals from 1961-1990 were used

# Sea Level

Sea level data comes from NOAA Tides & Currents stations, providing:

- Monthly mean sea level measurements
- Long-term sea level trends
- Relative sea level changes that reflect both:
  - Changes in local sea level over time
  - Vertical land motion
- Critical for coastal applications including:
  - Coastal mapping
  - Marine boundary delineation
  - Coastal zone management
  - Sustainable habitat restoration design

# Ocean Temperature

Sea surface temperature (SST) data is obtained from NOAA's satellite observations, featuring:

- Daily sea surface temperature measurements
- High-resolution satellite imagery
- Coverage of the entire Tampa Bay region
- Temperature values in degrees Celsius
- Important for monitoring:
  - Marine ecosystem health
  - Potential impacts on marine life
  - Long-term climate trends

# Hurricanes

Hurricane data is sourced from NOAA's historical hurricane tracks database:

- Historical storm tracks and intensities
- Coverage: Atlantic Basin
- Information includes:
  - Storm category
  - Wind speeds
  - Storm path
  - Duration
- Critical for understanding:
  - Storm frequency trends
  - Intensity patterns
  - Regional vulnerability
