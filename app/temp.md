Air temperature data is sourced from [PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model)](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/) climate data. PRISM provides high-quality spatial climate data sets developed by Oregon State University. The data includes:

- Daily minimum and maximum temperatures
- Coverage: Conterminous US from 1981 to present
- Resolution: 4km grid cells
- Data is typically updated within 24 hours

Data stability levels:
- Stable: data is considered final (before 6 months)
- Provisional: may be updated (previous 6 months)
- Early: preliminary data (this month)
